HMail is a GMail like web mail client built with Om.

GMail is a great client.
You can add your own pop3 account but not imap.
It will start downloading all your old mails where you'd just won't to get the first x newest.
Not everthing should go through Google, privacy wise.

Can it be done completely client-side or would a server-side component for the mailbox access be necessary/better?
Seems javascript does not have access to tcp/ip socket for this so solutions works through the browser or a server.

Client Server solution
Now it becomes a straightforward Om/Clojure app.
The server side has access to the mailbox and provides edn of email to the client
The client provides the GMail like look and functionality.

Functionality
keyboard shortcuts
Email list
chunked endless scroll
